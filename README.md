# C-to-I2C
## C programming from ground

`AIMS`

  To provide students with the background knowledge and practical experience to enable them to design and construct instrumentation systems based on digital techniques and safety interface digital systems to the real world.
  
`INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOME`
1. Knowledge and Understanding  
  *  Understand the principles and operating characteristic of commonly used transducer, analogue to digital/ digital to analogue converters (ADC/DAC), isolation and interfacing technique.

2. Subject-Specific - Cognitive Skills
  * Design basic instrumentation systems.
  * Analyse the requirements necessary to meet the desired performance of an electronic instrumentation system (speed, resolution and accuracy) or electronic interface for real world signal (analogue and digital).
  * Describe the influence of external factors such as cost, safety, noise, bandwith etc. on system desifign.

3. Subject-Specific - Practical Skills
  * Design basic interfaces (input/output, analogue/digital, serial/parallel) for embedded systems and constuct basic instrumentation systems.
  * Construct basic instrumentation systems and safely interface microcontrollers to the real world.

4. Key Tranferable Skills
 * Assess the interactions between commercial and technical issues in system design.
 * Program in C
